# to-do project

#### This README is available in: [🇷🇺](README_RU.md) [🇺🇦](README_UA.md)


A simple one-page to-do project based on pure javascript, css, html. it can partly be called secure, because the data is not stored on any servers, clouds and other stuff, but is stored directly in the local storage in the browser of the user. there is also a function of parsing to json file storage, i.e. export records and therefore there is a function of importing. at the moment i have implemented the following:
- change text when clicked
- the ability to delete-add items
- an attempt at adaptivity (successful XD)
- import and export items to json
- border animation (looks cool heh)
- a simple but beautiful design in my opinion
